    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> These cookies are made with simple ingredients and taste amazing. The shape makes them sort of resemble snowballs.
        These are a staple of Mexican weddings and pair great with tea. Usually made during the holdiays which adds to their festive look.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup of powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugare</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li> Beat butter, remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. 
             Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt utnil completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place
             2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes.
             (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)</li>
        <li> Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets for a moment before removing them from the wire racks.</li>
        <li> Roll hot cookies in the reserved powdered sugar to coat, then return to wire racks to cool.
             Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.</li>
